 Mission Statement:
 As a Corporate Executive,
 I want to have all of my employees, contractors and apprentices sign Non-Disclosure Agreements and other contracts.
 I want a record Who, What and When each document was sent to, signed, and returned.
 I want an easy-to-use Document Signer for the end-user.
 I want emails to be sent daily reminding each person of outstanding contracts that need to be signed.


 Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

 1. Store a Non-Disclosure Agreement as Electronically Signable Form.
 2. Display Form via a Link created per Recipient based upon their Email Address.
 3. Record when the NDA was sent to each recepient.
 4. Provide a simple Electronic Signature apparatus for each contract, similar to DocuSign.
 5. Display a Report showing Who, What and When each document was sent to, signed, and returned.
